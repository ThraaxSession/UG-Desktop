# UGD aka UG-Desktop aka Unified Gaming Desktop
Unified Gaming Desktop

Bazzite is awesome. But I want to have an app or desktop similar experience with all my game launchers on handheld.

## Features I wish to implement

* Own desktop environment based on GTK4 (with maybe Rust)
* UG shall support Bazzite infrastructure as separated desktop environment to minimize resources
* Launchers overview
* Showing basic stats in realtime: GPU/CPU/Mem/FPS
* Handheld input control (supported by HHD)
* Handheld friendly search
* Different modern themes (by day/night)
* On game overlay
* Selfhosting Gaming Social activies
* Social activities by opt-in
* Proton support for separate apps
* Table-based overview (Launchers/Installed Games/Social Activies)
* If wished, autostart of a specific launcher like Steam
* etc.

## PoC

* Create a basic desktop environment
* Shows all launchers which are installed
* Handle / manage PIDs of launchers
* Basic Input Control with HHD
* Start/Close launchers
* Basic overlay (Start/Close launchers)
* Basic theming
