# UG-Desktop
Unified Gaming Desktop

Bazzite is awesome. But I want to have an app or desktop similar experience with all my game launchers on handheld.

Features I wish to implement:

* Own desktop environment based on GTK4
* Launchers overview
* Showing basic stats in realtime: GPU/CPU/Mem stats
* Handheld input control (supported by HHD)
* Different themes (by day/night)
* On game overlay
